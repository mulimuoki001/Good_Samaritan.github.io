                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>"Good Samaritan Foundation" is a creative project to close the gap between excess food and the needs
                    of vulnerable people in Kigali, where two million tons of food go to waste every year. In
                    Rwanda-Kigali, where restaurants and hotels contribute to excess garbage and humanitarian groups
                    struggle with little funding, the project addresses the widespread global issue of food waste and
                    hunger.


                    The project's main objective is to establish a sustainable system that effectively gathers excess
                    food and distributes it to those in need while keeping a close eye on environmental preservation.
                    The project's strategic planning acknowledges and includes the logistical issues of distribution,
                    transportation, and food safety standards. Beyond the complexities of logistics, the project expects
                    to significantly influence the health of marginalised groups, especially children, by providing
                    appropriate and nutritional meals.</p>

                <p>As the project's focal point, Kigali is strategically chosen for its concentration of resources and
                    needs. "Good Samaritan Rwanda" introduces a creative online platform designed as a centralised hub,
                    facilitating the efficient collection, coordination, and redistribution of surplus food. The
                    website's key features include a comprehensive database, enabling the tailored matching of excess
                    food with the specific dietary needs of charitable institutions. Participating restaurants and
                    hotels will register on the platform, detailing excess availability, cuisine type, and preferred
                    donation schedules. The platform fosters communication and feedback between donors and recipients,
                    ensuring a cohesive and impactful donation process.</p>

                <p>The Good Samaritan Foundation is a transformative initiative dedicated to addressing hunger and
                    environmental sustainability by establishing a vital link between surplus food from hotels and
                    restaurants and those in need, including children's homes and charitable organizations. This
                    innovative project not only tackles the pressing issue of food insecurity by redirecting unused
                    resources to vulnerable populations but also contributes significantly to environmental conservation
                    by preventing the decomposition of excess food waste. Through a collaborative effort between the
                    hospitality industry and charitable organizations, the Good Samaritan Project exemplifies a
                    community-driven approach, emphasizing the importance of shared responsibility in combating social
                    challenges and promoting sustainable practices. This endeavor stands as a beacon of compassion,
                    efficiently channeling surplus resources to nourish the underserved while actively participating in
                    the global effort to reduce food waste and its environmental repercussions. </p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>In Kigali, excessive food waste coexists, with a significant portion of the population facing hunger.
                    Surplus food from restaurants and hotels goes unused, contributing to environmental pollution.
                    Charitable organizations struggle to meet the dietary needs of the underprivileged. The Good
                    Samaritan Project aims to address this challenge by efficiently redistributing surplus food,
                    reducing waste, and promoting environmental conservation.We will create an app which will be the hub
                    for connecting all the stakeholders.
